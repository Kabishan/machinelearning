# Machine Learning Projects

I have decided to venture into the world of Machine Learning (ML). After learning web development for some time now, I felt that I should expand my horizons. In this repository, you will find some ML projects that I have been working on. At this moment, I find ML to be a nice change of pace and interesting to learn. Bear in mind that these are practical projects and I have been supplementing my learning through theory as well.

# Car Sales Project

This is my first ML project. In this project, I have been taking steps towards building an artifical neural network (ANN) that given 5 inputs: Gender, Age, Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt and Net Worth, can predict the output: Car Purchasing Price. 

I have used a supervised regression model with synthetic customer data. The model is supervised because I use labeled training data and the model is regression based because I am looking for a continous value. Between the hidden layers, I have used the relu activation function and a linear activation function from the last hidden layer to the output layer to not remove negative values.

These are some technologies I have used: 
- pandas
- numpy 
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- tensorflow
- keras
